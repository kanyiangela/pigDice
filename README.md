pigDice GAME

The game has two players
In each turn a player roles the dice as many times as he or she wishes unless they role a 1 hence it is the next players turn.
The player who roles the 1 does not lose his round score but resumes from where he was before he rolled a 1.
The first player to reach 100 point on a global score wins.
